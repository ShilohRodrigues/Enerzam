            <p>Over the years, EnerZam has progressed immensely. We started by <span class="bold">developing Joule Analytix</span> for our Building Engineers so they could perform their daily mandates more efficiently and in a timely manner. As technology advanced, so did <span class="bold">Joule Analytix</span> software.</p>
            <p>We hired more developers, designers, and engineers who brought in fresh ideas and expertise to the table. We continue <span class="bold">developing more sophisticated modules</span> that could handle complex tasks and processes.</p>
