            <h2>Industrial & Commercial</h2>
            <p>According to the <span class="bold">International Energy Agency (IEA)</span>, commercial and industrial
              buildings are responsible for approximately 39% of global CO2 emissions. This highlights
              a significant opportunity for impactful change. EnerZam is uniquely positioned to help
              you capitalize on this opportunity.</p>
            <p>We offer tailored solutions to enhance energy efficiency through optimized building
              design, sustainable materials, advanced water conservation strategies, and cutting-edge
              energy management systems. Our expertise in smart building technologies ensures that
              your operations not only reduce carbon emissions but also achieve substantial cost
              savings and improved performance. Most importantly, our solutions are designed to

            <h2>Hospitals</h2>
            <p>Hospitals operate around the clock, with high demands for electricity and thermal energy
              every day of the year. They require stringent ventilation, air conditioning, and air quality
              controls to ensure a safe and effective environment for patients. According to the Canada
              Green Building Council, "a large percentage of Canada's hospital buildings were
              constructed before 1990, when energy efficiency standards and green building practices
              were less common." This highlights a significant opportunity for improvement, as
              hospitals exhibit the highest energy consumption per unit of floor area among public-use
              buildings, leading to substantial utility expenses.</p>
            <p>Understanding the critical nature of healthcare services, EnerZam offers comprehensive
              solutions tailored to enhance energy efficiency and sustainability in your facility.</p>    
            <p>Our expertise spans detailed facility assessments, strategic energy services, and
              innovative software solutions such as our WebSynco CMMS, Joule M&V, and Joule
              Analytix. We provide the tools needed to optimize performance, reduce costs, and
              improve energy management without compromising patient care.</p>
